# Pomodoro Clock

## Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro.

## The Application
The application allows the user to specify the duration of the pomodoro session and the break. Upon the completion of each countdown, a sound is played indicating that the time is up. The timer can also be paused by the user.
